Kubernetes 30-day development plan series
This article uses k8s as the base, introduces the architecture and related components of k8s, and uses it as an application. The outline is as follows:
1. Introduction to k8s architecture and related components, usage scenarios (Basic objects and Advanced objects).
2. Basic usage of Docker and connection with k8s.
3. Set up k8s in the cloud. Here we take AWS as an example and use EKS to simultaneously introduce the use and setting of AWS.
4. Advanced applications of k8s, resource monitoring, management, backup within the cluster, and even cross-cluster communication, etc.
5. The recent development and future of k8s.
